### Install
You can run those functions in your own local environment. 
To run, you need to install RUBY on your computer. For windows, you can go to [Ruby installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/) and for MAC and LINUX you can go to [Ruby official site](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) for instructions on how to install it.

Then you can clone the project by typing ```git clone https://github.com/RaminMammadzada/ruby-web-scraper.git```

### Dependencies
You must install the following gems:
   - ```gem install kimurai```
   - ```gem install colorize```
   - ```gem install chrome-webdriver```

You must also have ```chromedriver``` in your local development environment.
- On Mac OS:
   - Method 1: with ```brew```
       - ```brew install chromedriver```
   - Method 2: normal installation
       - ```curl http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.38/chromedriver_mac64.zip -o chromedriver_mac64.zip```
       - ```unzip chromedriver_mac64.zip```
       - ```mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin```
       - ```chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chromedriver```
       
- On Linux,  and chromedriver (use proper path for your system and version):
   - Install chrome first
       -  ```wget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add -```
       -  ```sh -c 'echo "deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google.list'```
       -  ```apt-get update```
       -  ```apt-get install google-chrome-stable```
   - Insall chromedriver (use proper path for your system and version)
       -  ```wget http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.7/chromedriver_linux64.zip```
       -  ```unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip```
       -  ```cp chromedriver /usr/local/bin```
       -  ```chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chromedriver```

### Run app

        * ![screenshot of step 3](./images/step3_screenshot.png)
        - All of the fetched products' informations are saved to [product_search_result.json](product_search_result.json) file.

        - If there is no product found, then it means there is no matching category for your keywords or you gave the price range too narrow. You should run the app again and try other keywords or price range.
