- [x] Milestone 1 - CLI user interface is implemented.
- [x] Milestone 2 - Implement logic to retrieve data from the webpage and store them in a JSON file.
- [x] Milestone 3 - Update codebase to follow OOP principles

    ![screenshot of step 3](./images/step3_screenshot.png)
        - All of the fetched products' informations are saved to [product_search_result.json](product_search_result.json) file.
        ![screenshot of step 3](images/step3b_screenshot.png)
        - If there is no product found, then it means there is no matching category for your keywords or you gave the price range too narrow. You should run the app again and try other keywords or price range.
